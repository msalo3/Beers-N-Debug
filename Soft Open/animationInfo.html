      <h3>Events</h3>
      <p>
        There are many different events that can be handled by JQuery.<br>
        Some of the more basic and easy ones to use are:<br>
        <u>.click</u>, <u>.on</u>, <u>.hover</u>, <u>.mouseenter</u>, etc
      </p>

      <h3>Speed</h3>
      <p>
        Animation speed is measured in milliseconds.<br>
        The larger the number, the longer the animation will take.<br>
        <br>
        You can also use the keywords <u>'slow'</u>, <u>'normal'</u>, and <u>'fast'</u>,<br>
        which are 600, 400, and 200 milliseconds respectively.
        <br>
      </p>

      <h3>Easing</h3>
      <p>
        This is how the animation will look.<br>
        For example, if I have text moving 200 px to the left,<br>
        I can have an easing that makes it move 90% of the way very quickly <br>
        and then move slowly for the last 10%.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are only 2 easings in the JQuery library: <u>linear</u> and <u>swing</u><br>
        - swing is slightly faster at the beginning and end<br>
        - linear is constant throughout<br>
        There are many more easings that you can use in other libraries online.
        <br>
      </p>

      <h3>Callback</h3>
      <p>
        Callback is where you can tell JQuery to run another function once the current function is finished.<br>
        You can write a function beforehand and call it <br>
        or you can make an anonymous function and write the code in the first function
        <br>
      </p>

      <h3>setTimeout</h3>
      <p>
        This acts as a delay function.<br>
        It takes in a function and a number of milliseconds as parameters. <br>
        It waits the number of milliseconds and then runs the function.
        <br>
      </p>

      <h3>Position</h3>
      <p>
        Set the position to relative or absolute or else many effects will not work.<br>
        <br>
        <u>Position-relative</u>:
        <br>Can move the element from where it would originally have been
        located.
        <br>This means it will still take up that space on the page.
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>Position-absolute</u>:
        <br>This element will be positioned in relation to it's nearest
        ancestor on the page.
        <br>
      </p>

      <h3>CSS differences</h3>
      <p>
        CSS styles like min-height are written as minHeight.<br>
        Every quantity that is given to a CSS style is in the form of a string.<br>
          ie - left: '20px'
        <br>
      </p>
