Going back over (for our purposes)

HTML - the Content of the page
- this is the actual information that you want displayed on the page

CSS - Style
- This is HOW the content is displayed.
- It also contains some “content” like borders, but this is usually still dependent on what the content is

JS - how you can dynamically change both the content and the css
- JS serves other functions, but we aren’t going to worry about that today


example of basic javascript function that changes text

JQUERY - shortened JS
- does the same thing as JS but it’s quicker to write


Basic Jquery effects - Hide and Show

HIDE

Hide and show are very easy Jquery functions to learn. They take whichever element you select and either
hide it or show it. If an element is already hidden, .hide() will not hide it and the same goes for .show()
if the element is already shown.

.toggle() can be used to change between hiding and showing depending on whichever the element currently is.
