Going back over (for our purposes)

HTML - the Content of the page
- this is the actual information that you want displayed on the page

CSS - Style
- This is HOW the content is displayed.
- It also contains some “content” like borders, but this is usually still dependent on what the content is

JS - how you can dynamically change both the content and the css
- JS serves other functions, but we aren’t going to worry about that today


example of basic javascript function that changes text

JQUERY - shortened JS
- does the same thing as JS but it’s quicker to write


Basic JQuery effects - Hide and Show

HIDE

Hide and show are very easy JQuery functions to learn. They take whichever element
you select and either hide it or show it. If an element is already hidden, .hide()
will not hide it and the same goes for .show() if the element is already shown.

.toggle() can be used to change between hiding and showing depending on whichever the element currently is.


Animation
  - Alter an HTML element's CSS properties
  - Altering multiple properties at once
  - Make a queue of multiple properties that will go off one after another
  - Using recursion to continually animate an element


  Need to talk about
  - Events (onclick, on hover, etc)
    There are many different events that can be handled by JQuery. Some of the more
    basic and easy ones to use are: .click, .on, .hover, .mouseenter, etc

  - Speed
    Animation speed is measured in milliseconds. The larger the number, the longer
    the animation will take. You can also use the keywords 'slow', 'normal', and
    'fast', which are 600, 400, and 200 respectively

  - Easing
    This is how the animation looks. For example, if I have text moving 200 px to
    the left, I can have an easing that makes it move 90% of the way very quickly
    and then move slowly for the last 10%.
    There are only 2 easings in the JQuery library: linear and swing
      - swing is slightly faster at the beginning and end
      - linear is constant throughout
    There are many more easings that you can use in other libraries online.

  - Callback
    Callback is where you can tell JQuery to run another function once the current
    function is finished. You can write a function beforehand and call it or you can
    make an anonymous function and write the code in the first function

  - setTimeout()
    This acts as a delay function. It takes in a function and a number of milliseconds
    as parameters. It waits the number of milliseconds and then runs the function.

  - Position
    Set the position to relative or absolute or else many effects will not work
    Position-relative: Can move the element from where it would originally have been
    located. This means it will still take up that space on the page.
    Position-absolute: This element will be positioned in relation to it's nearest
    ancestor on the page.

  - CSS differences
    CSS styles like min-height are written as minHeight .
    Every quantity that is given to a CSS style is in the form of a string.
      ie - left: '20px'
